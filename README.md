## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure Python 3.11 is installed on your system. Higher versions might work but are not tested. It is also recommended to manage your Python dependencies with a virtual environment to prevent conflicts with other packages.

### Steps to install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Access the PLMFit repository and clone it to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LSSI-ETH/plmfit.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd plmfit
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   - For Windows:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
   - For SLURM setups (Euler):
      Load a python module to subsequently be able to install PLMFit. For example, in ETH Euler Cluster:
      ```bash
      module load stack/2024-06 gcc/12.2.0
      module load python/3.11.6
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install PLMFit:**
   Install PLMFit using pip within your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   DeepSpeed is only needed to train on GPUs with the DeepSpeed ZeRO strategy. If it cannot be installed on your machine (building it requires the CUDA toolkit), remove the `deepspeed` line from `requirements.txt` before installing: PLMFit then runs on a single device with the default Lightning strategy.

### Configuration

Configure the `.env` file in the root directory as follows:

For local setups only the data and config folder paths need to be defined:
```
DATA_DIR='./data'
CONFIG_DIR='./config'
```

For Euler and SLURM an absolute path is required. To use the SLURM scripts, the username and virtual environment need to be defined as well:
```
DATA_DIR='/absolute/path/to/plmfit'
CONFIG_DIR='/absolute/path/to/config'
SLURM_USERNAME='slurm_username'
VIRTUAL_ENV='/absolute/path/to/venv'
```

Data needs to follow a specific structure to be readble by PLMFit. All data should be place in the `./data folder` in a `{data_type}` named subfolder. The dataset has to be a csv file named `{data_type}_data_full.csv` inside the subfolder and the columns should be in a specific format. The mandatory fields are `aa_seq` for the amino-acid sequence, `len` for the length of the sequence, `score`/`binary_score`/`label` depending on the task (regression/binary classification/multi-class classification). For detailed data structure and setup, refer to the [data management guide](./data/README.md).

## Usage

PLMFit facilitates easy application of Protein Language Models (PLMs) for embedding extraction, fine-tuning, and other machine learning tasks through a user-friendly command-line interface. Below are detailed instructions for using PLMFit to perform various tasks:

### Extracting embeddings

To extract embeddings from supported PLMs, use the following command structure:

```bash
python3 plmfit --function extract_embeddings \
               --data_type <dataset_short_name> \
               --plm <model_name> \
               --output_dir <output_directory> \
               --experiment_dir <experiment_directory> \
               --experiment_name <name_of_experiment> \
               --layer <layer_option> \
               --reduction <reduction_method>
```

**Parameters:**
- `--function extract_embeddings`: Initiates the embedding extraction process.
- `--data_type`: Short name for the data to be used, as per naming conventions in README.
- `--plm`: Specifies the pre-trained model from supported PLMs.
- `--output_dir`: Directory for output, required for using the Euler SLURM scripts.
- `--experiment_dir`: Directory where experiment output files will be stored.
- `--experiment_name`: A unique name for identifying the experiment.
- `--layer`: (Optional) Specifies the model layer from which to extract embeddings ('first', 'quarter1', 'middle', 'quarter3', 'last'—default, or a specific layer number).
- `--reduction`: (Optional) Pooling method for embeddings ('mean'—default, 'bos', 'eos', 'sum', 'none'-requires substantial storage space).

**Extracting embeddings from a fine-tuned model:**
By default the embeddings are those of the pretrained PLM. To extract them from a PLM fine-tuned with PLMFit (see [Fine-Tuning models](#fine-tuning-models)), pass the checkpoint saved by the fine-tuning run and how it was obtained:
- `--model_path`: Path of the checkpoint of the fine-tuning run (`<experiment_dir>/lightning_logs/best_model.ckpt`).
- `--ft_method`: Fine-tuning method of that run, 'lora' or 'full' (bottleneck adapters are not supported).
- `--target_layers`, `--lora_config_path`: The values used for fine-tuning, if different from the defaults.

Only the backbone is taken from the checkpoint (with LoRA, the low-rank updates are merged into its weights), while the head is discarded. `--plm` must be the PLM that was fine-tuned, and the fine-tuning must have been run on the whole model (`--layer last`, the default); `--layer` and `--reduction` select, as usual, what to extract. A checkpoint that does not match the model stops the run with an error. To train a head on these embeddings with feature extraction, pass the path of the resulting .pt file with `--embeddings_path`.

The output from the embedding extraction is a .pt file (PyTorch tensor) which contains the numerical representations of the sequences. Each sequence is transformed into an embedding vector, and the file size is determined by the number of sequences and the embedding size, essentially forming a matrix of size Sequences length X Embedding size. This structured data can then be used directly for machine learning models, providing a powerful toolset for predictive analytics and further research.

**Why Extract embeddings?**
Extracting embeddings from protein sequences is a foundational step in bioinformatics. It converts amino-acid sequences in a contexualy and information rich numerical representation (i.e. embeddings) by exploitting evolutionary and structural knowledge acquired during PLMs' pretraining. Embeddings can capture the intrinsic properties of proteins in a way that highlights their biological functionalities and interactions, which are beneficial input features for tasks such as protein classification, structure prediction, and function annotation.

### Fine-Tuning models

Fine-tune supported PLMs using various techniques with the following command:

```bash
python3 -u plmfit --function fine_tuning \
                  --ft_method <fine_tuning_method> \
                  --target_layers <layer_targeting_option> \
                  --head_config <head_configuration_file> \
                  --data_type <dataset_short_name> \
                  --split <dataset_split> \
                  --plm <model_name> \
                  --output_dir <output_directory> \
                  --experiment_dir <experiment_directory> \
                  --experiment_name <name_of_experiment> \
                  --embeddings_path <embeddings_path_including_filename> \
                  --ray_tuning <bool>
```

**Fine-Tuning methods:**
- `--ft_method`: Specifies the fine-tuning method ('feature_extraction', 'full', 'lora', 'bottleneck_adapters').
- `--target_layers`: Targets specific layers ('all' or 'last'), not applicable for 'feature_extraction'.
- `--head_config`: JSON configuration file for the head, defining the task (regression, classification, domain adaptation). This JSON file needs to be located in `./config/training/` folder. The argument should be the relative path of the file to the `./config/training/` folder. For further documentation on how the head should be structured, refer to the [training management guide](./config/training/README.md).
- `--embeddings_path`: Path to the previously generated embeddings.
- `--ray_tuning`: Specifies if hyperparameter optimization is performed ('True' or 'False')
- `--keep_checkpoint`: (Optional) Set to 'False' to delete the best checkpoint once the fine-tuned model has been tested, for instance to save disk space when running many experiments ('True'—default).
- `--ckpt_staging_dir`: (Optional) Directory where the best checkpoint is written while training, before being moved to the experiment directory at the end of the run. Point it to a local disk when the experiment directory is on a slow network file system: no checkpoint is then written to the experiment directory during training. If a run is interrupted, its checkpoint is left in the staging directory.

The checkpoint with the lowest validation loss is saved in the experiment directory as `lightning_logs/best_model.ckpt`, or as `best_model.ckpt` when training with DeepSpeed. Its path can be passed with `--model_path` to evaluate the model again (`--evaluate True`).

**Understanding Fine-Tuning methods:**
1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Description: This method involves extracting embeddings with a pre-trained model before fine-tuning a new head on these embeddings. It is less computationally intensive as it does not require updating the weights of the pre-trained model. To automatically use embeddings extracted beforehand, use the same `output_dir` argument.
   - Prerequisite: Embedding extraction must be completed first, as it uses these embeddings as input. The argument `embeddings_path` needs to be passed pointing to the full path -including .pt file name- to embeddings.
   - Pros: Efficient in terms of computation; reduces the risk of overfitting on small datasets.
   - Cons: May not capture as complex patterns as methods that update deeper model layers.
2. **Full Fine-Tuning:**
   - Description: The layers of the model are updated during training. This method is suitable for tasks where the new dataset is large and significantly different from the data the model was initially trained on.
   - Pros: Can significantly improve model performance on the task-specific data.
   - Cons: Requires more computational resources; higher risk of overfitting on small datasets.
3. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
   - Description: Modifies only a small part of the model's weights in a low-rank format, reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated.
   - Pros: Less resource-intensive compared to full fine-tuning; can be effective even with smaller amounts of training data.
   - Cons: Might not capture as wide a range of adaptations as full fine-tuning.
4. **Bottleneck Adapters:**
   - Description: Introduces small bottleneck layers within the model that are trained while keeping the majority of the model's weights fixed.
   - Pros: Allows for more targeted model updates without the need for extensive retraining of the entire network.
   - Cons: May require careful tuning of the bottleneck architecture to achieve desired improvements.

**Advanced usage:**
You can change the configuration of LoRA and Bottleneck Adapters by adapting the relevant config file found in `./config/peft/` folder. Change these parameters only if you have experience with these methods or want to experiment with different settings. To keep several LoRA configurations side by side instead of editing the default file, pass `--lora_config_path` with the path of the file to use, relative to the config folder (default: `peft/lora_config.json`).

**Sequential fine-tuning:**
A model can be fine-tuned starting from the backbone of a model that was fine-tuned on another task, instead of the pretrained PLM. Pass the checkpoint saved by the first run with `--model_path`:

```bash
# 1. Fine-tune on the first task
python3 -u plmfit --function fine_tuning \
                  --ft_method lora \
                  --head_config <head_configuration_of_first_task> \
                  --data_type <first_dataset> \
                  --split <dataset_split> \
                  --plm <model_name> \
                  --output_dir <output_directory> \
                  --experiment_dir <first_experiment_directory> \
                  --experiment_name <first_experiment>

# 2. Fine-tune on the second task, starting from the model fine-tuned on the first
python3 -u plmfit --function fine_tuning \
                  --ft_method lora \
                  --head_config <head_configuration_of_second_task> \
                  --data_type <second_dataset> \
                  --split <dataset_split> \
                  --plm <model_name> \
                  --model_path <first_experiment_directory>/lightning_logs/best_model.ckpt \
                  --output_dir <output_directory> \
                  --experiment_dir <second_experiment_directory> \
                  --experiment_name <second_experiment>
```

The second run takes from the checkpoint the weights of the PLM and of its LoRA or bottleneck adapters, and keeps training them. The rest is new: the head is initialized as usual, since the two tasks are in general different, and training starts from the first epoch with a new optimizer (the first run is not resumed).

The two runs must use the same `--plm`, `--layer`, `--ft_method` and `--target_layers`, and the same LoRA or adapter configuration: if the weights expected by the model and those in the checkpoint differ, the run stops with an error instead of falling back to the pretrained weights. The LoRA scaling factor (`lora_alpha`) is not a weight and cannot be checked this way, so make sure it is the same in the two runs, for instance by giving both the same `--lora_config_path`.

### Train One-Hot Encoding models

To train models using one-hot encoding, utilize:

```bash
python3 -u plmfit --function one_hot \
                  --head_config <head_configuration_file> \
                  --data_type <dataset_short_name> \
                  --split <dataset_split> \
                  --output_dir <output_directory> \
                  --experiment_dir <experiment_directory> \
                  --experiment_name <name_of_experiment>
```

### Using PLMFit on a SLURM setup (e.g. Euler)
Navigate to the `scripts` folder, where you will find subfolders for each of the platform's features. Adjust the `experiments_setup.csv` file according to your needs and simply call `./scripts/{function}/submit_{function}_mass.sh` from the parent directory. The columns in this file represent various arguments, most of which are the same as those mentioned previously. Here are the key columns:

- `gpus`: The number of GPUs to request.
- `gres`: The type of GPU to request, either by name or by size.
- `mem-per-cpu`: The amount of CPU RAM to allocate per GPU.
- `nodes`: The number of nodes to request.
- `run_time`: The duration for which the job should run in hours.
- `experimenting`: Set this if you want to benchmark speed, resource usage, etc.

Use tabs as deliminators and the last line has to stay blank, otherwise the scripts will not function.
